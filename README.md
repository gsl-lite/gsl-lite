Example usage
-------------

```Cpp
#include "gsl/gsl-lite.hpp"

using namespace gsl;

int * use( not_null<int *> p ) 
{
    // use p knowing it's not nullptr, NULL or 0.
    
    return p;
}

struct Widget
{
    Widget() : owned_ptr( new int(42) ) {}
    ~Widget() { delete owned_ptr; }

    void work() { non_owned_ptr = use( owned_ptr ); }
    
    owner<int *> owned_ptr;	// if alias template support
//  Owner(int *) owned_ptr;	// C++98 up
    int * non_owned_ptr;
};

int main()
{
    Widget w;
    w.work();
}
```

### Compile and run

```
prompt>g++ -std=c++03 -Wall -I../include -o 01-basic.exe 01-basic.cpp && 01-basic.exe
```

In a nutshell
-------------
**gsl-lite** is a single-file header-only variant of Microsoft's implementation of the [Guidelines Support Library (GSL)](https://github.com/Microsoft/GSL) adapted for C++98, C++03. It should also work when compiled as C++11, C++14, C++17.

The Guidelines Support Library (GSL) contains functions and types that are suggested for use by the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://github.com/isocpp/CppCoreGuidelines) maintained by the [Standard C++ Foundation](https://isocpp.org/). The library includes types like `owner<>`, `not_null<>`, `span<>`, `string_span` and [others](#features).

*gsl-lite* recognizes when it is compiled for the CUDA platform and decorates functions (methods) with `__host__` and `__device__`. See also section [API macro](#api-macro).


License
-------
*gsl-lite* uses the [MIT](LICENSE) license.
 

Dependencies
------------
*gsl-lite* has no other dependencies than the [C++ standard library](http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/header).


Installation and use
--------------------
*gsl-lite* is a single-file header-only library. There are various ways to use it in your project. 

**Contents**  
- [As copied header](#as-copied-header)
- [As external Git project](#as-external-git-project)
- [As CMake package](#as-cmake-package)
- [As Conan package](#as-conan-package)
- [As Conda package](#as-conda-package)

### As copied header

Put a copy of [`gsl-lite.hpp`](include/gsl/gsl-lite.hpp) located in folder [include/gsl](include/gsl) directly into the project source tree or somewhere reachable from your project, for example in *project-root*/include/gsl. If you like to refer to gsl-lite as `gsl`, also copy the file [`gsl`](include/gsl/gsl). A minimal CMake setup using this header might look as follows.

In project root folder:

```CMake
cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.5 FATAL_ERROR )

project( use-gsl-lite LANGUAGES CXX )

# Provide #include access to gsl-lite as 'gsl/gsl' and as 'gsl/gsl-lite.hpp': 

set( GSL_LITE_INCLUDE_DIR include )  # adapt as necessary
add_library( gsl INTERFACE )
target_include_directories( gsl INTERFACE ${GSL_LITE_INCLUDE_DIR} )

# Build program from src:

add_subdirectory( src ) 
```

In folder src:

```CMake
cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.5 FATAL_ERROR )

project( program-using-gsl-lite LANGUAGES CXX )

# Make program executable:

set( SOURCES main.cpp)
add_executable( program ${SOURCES} )
target_link_libraries( program PRIVATE gsl )
```

### As external Git project

Another approach is to automatically fetch the entire *gsl-lite* repository from github and configure it as an external project.

```CMake
cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.5 FATAL_ERROR )

project( use-gsl-lite LANGUAGES CXX )

# Set default ExternalProject root directory and add gsl-lite:

set( GSL_LITE_URL https://github.com/martinmoene/gsl-lite.git )

include( ExternalProject )
find_package( Git REQUIRED )

set_directory_properties( PROPERTIES EP_PREFIX ${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/3rd_party )

ExternalProject_Add(
    gsl-extern
    GIT_REPOSITORY ${GSL_LITE_URL}
    TIMEOUT 10
    UPDATE_COMMAND ${GIT_EXECUTABLE} pull
    CONFIGURE_COMMAND ""
    BUILD_COMMAND ""
    INSTALL_COMMAND ""
    LOG_DOWNLOAD ON
   )

# Provide #include access to gsl-lite as 'gsl/gsl' and as 'gsl/gsl-lite.hpp': 

ExternalProject_Get_Property( gsl-extern SOURCE_DIR )
set( GSL_LITE_INCLUDE_DIR ${SOURCE_DIR}/include CACHE INTERNAL "Include folder for gsl-lite")

add_library( gsl INTERFACE )
target_include_directories( gsl INTERFACE ${GSL_LITE_INCLUDE_DIR} )

# Build program from src:

add_subdirectory( src ) 
```

In folder src:
```CMake
cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.5 FATAL_ERROR )

project( program-using-gsl-lite LANGUAGES CXX )

# Make program executable:

set( SOURCES main.cpp)
add_executable( program ${SOURCES} )
target_link_libraries( program PRIVATE gsl )
```

This setup brings in more than you need, but also makes it easy to update *gsl-lite* to the latest version.  See [example/cmake-extern](example/cmake-extern) for a complete example.


### As CMake package

1. First install the *gsl-lite* CMake package from its source, for example:

		cd ./gsl-lite
		cmake -H. -B../_build -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="~/dev"
		cmake --build ../_build --target install

	See also [script/install-gsl-pkg.py](script/install-gsl-pkg.py) that can perform these steps for you. It also lets you control compiler and build configuration.

2. Next, you can use the *gsl-lite* CMake package, for example:

	```CMake
	cmake_minimum_required( VERSION 3.5 FATAL_ERROR )
	
	find_package( gsl-lite "0.33" REQUIRED )
	
	project( program-using-gsl-lite LANGUAGES CXX )
	
	add_executable(        program main.cpp )
	target_link_libraries( program PRIVATE gsl::gsl-lite )
	```
	Configure and build:

		cd ./gsl-lite/example/cmake-pkg
		cmake -H. -B../_build -G"Unix Makefiles" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=_stage -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="~/dev"
		cmake --build ../_build

	See [example/cmake-pkg/Readme.md](example/cmake-pkg/Readme.md) for a complete example.

### As Conan package

For the [conan package manager](https://www.conan.io/), follow these steps:

1. Add *nonstd-lite* to the conan remotes:

        conan remote add nonstd-lite https://api.bintray.com/conan/martinmoene/nonstd-lite

2. Add a reference to *gsl-lite* to the *requires* section of your project's `conanfile.txt` file:

        [requires]
        gsl-lite/0.34.0@nonstd-lite/stable

3. Run conan's install command:

        conan install

### As Conda package

1. For the [conda package manager](https://conda.io), first use **one of these options** to install `gsl-lite` from the [`conda-forge`](https://conda-forge.org/) channel:

 * Install it in the current environment:

        conda install -c conda-forge gsl-lite

 * Install it in a different environment (named `env_name` in this example):

        conda install -n env_name -c conda-forge gsl-lite

 * Create a new environment containing *gsl-lite* (and possibly other packages, appended at the end of the command):

        conda create -n env_name -c conda-forge gsl-lite cmake

 * Add it to an already existing [`environment.yml`](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file) file, and update the environment using:

        conda env update

2. Then activate the environment using `conda activate env_name` (if not already activated) and proceed using the instructions from step 2 of ["As CMake package"](#as-cmake-package). Note that it's also useful to have the `cmake` package in the same environment, and explicitly passing `-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` is not necessary.

- [Standard selection macro](#standard-selection-macro)
- [Feature selection macros](#feature-selection-macros)
- [Contract violation response macros](#contract-violation-response-macros)
- [Microsoft GSL compatibility macros](#microsoft-gsl-compatibility-macros)
- [Other configuration macros](#other-configuration-macros)

### API macro

\-D<b>gsl\_api</b>=""  
Functions (methods) are decorated with `gsl_api`. At default `gsl_api` is defined empty for non-CUDA platforms and `__host__ __device__` for the CUDA platform. Define this macro to specify your own function decoration. 

### Standard selection macro

\-D<b>gsl\_CPLUSPLUS</b>=199711L  
Define this macro to override the auto-detection of the supported C++ standard, if your compiler does not set the `__cplusplus` macro correctly.

### Feature selection macros

\-D<b>gsl\_FEATURE\_WITH\_CONTAINER\_TO\_STD</b>=99  
Define this to the highest C++ standard (98, 3, 11, 14, 17, 20) you want to include tagged-construction via `with_container`. Default is 99 for inclusion with any standard.

\-D<b>gsl\_FEATURE\_MAKE\_SPAN\_TO\_STD</b>=99  
Define this to the highest C++ standard (98, 3, 11, 14, 17, 20) you want to include `make_span()` creator functions. Default is 99 for inclusion with any standard.

\-D<b>gsl\_FEATURE\_BYTE\_SPAN\_TO\_STD</b>=99  
Define this to the highest C++ standard (98, 3, 11, 14, 17, 20) you want to include `byte_span()` creator functions. Default is 99 for inclusion with any standard.

\-D<b>gsl\_FEATURE\_IMPLICIT\_MACRO</b>=0  
Define this macro to 1 to provide the `implicit` macro. Default is 0.

\-D<b>gsl\_FEATURE\_OWNER\_MACRO</b>=1  
At default macro `Owner()` is defined for all C++ versions. This may be useful to transition  from a compiler that doesn't provide alias templates to one that does. Define this macro to 0 to omit the `Owner()` macro. Default is 1.

\-D<b>gsl\_FEATURE\_EXPERIMENTAL\_RETURN\_GUARD</b>=0  
Provide experimental types `final_action_return` and `final_action_error` and convenience functions `on_return()` and `on_error()`. Default is 0.

### Contract violation response macros

*gsl-lite* provides contract violation response control as originally suggested in proposal [N4415](http://wg21.link/n4415), with some refinements inspired by [P1710](http://wg21.link/P1710)/[P1730](http://wg21.link/P1730).

There are four macros for expressing pre- and postconditions:

- `Expects` for simple preconditions
- `Ensures` for simple postconditions
- `ExpectsAudit` for preconditions that are expensive or include potentially opaque function calls
- `EnsuresAudit` for postconditions that are expensive or include potentially opaque function calls


The contract checking level can be controlled by defining one of the following macros:

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_LEVEL\_AUDIT</b>  
Define this macro to have all contracts checked at runtime.
 
\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_LEVEL\_ON</b>  
Define this macro to have contracts expressed with `Expects` and `Ensures` checked at runtime, and contracts expressed with `ExpectsAudit` and `EnsuresAudit` not checked and not evaluated at runtime. This is the default case.
 
\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_LEVEL\_ASSUME</b>  
Define this macro to let the compiler assume that contracts expressed with `Expects` and `Ensures` always hold true (which may incur evaluation at runtime), and to have contracts expressed with `ExpectsAudit` and `EnsuresAudit` not checked and not evaluated at runtime.
 
\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_LEVEL\_OFF</b>  
Define this macro to disable all runtime checking and evaluation of contracts.


Note that the distinction between regular and audit-level contracts is subtly different from the C++2a Contracts proposals. When <b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_LEVEL\_ASSUME</b> is defined, the compiler is instructed that the
condition expressed by regular contracts can be assumed to hold true. This is meant to be an aid for the optimizer; runtime evaluation of the condition is not desired. However, because the GSL implements contract checks
with macros rather than as a language feature, it cannot reliably suppress runtime evaluation of a condition for all compilers. If the contract comprises a function call which is opaque to the compiler, many compilers will
generate the runtime function call.

Therefore, `Expects` and `Ensures` should be used only for conditions that can be proven side-effect-free by the compiler, and `ExpectsAudit` and `EnsuresAudit` for everything else. In practice, this implies that
`Expects` and `Ensures` should only be used for simple comparisons of scalar values and for comparisons of class objects with trivially inlineable comparison operators.


Example:

```Cpp
template <typename It> // assuming random-access iterators
auto median( It first, It last )
{
        // Comparing iterators for equality boils down to a comparison of pointers. An optimizing
        // compiler will inline the comparison operator and understand that the comparison is free
        // of side-effects, and hence generate no code in gsl_CONFIG_CONTRACT_LEVEL_ASSUME mode.
    Expects( first != last );

        // Verifying that a range of elements is sorted may be an expensive operation, and we
        // cannot trust the compiler to understand that it is free of side-effects, so we use an
        // audit-level contract check.
    ExpectsAudit( std::is_sorted( first, last ) );

    auto count = last - first;
    return count % 2 != 0
        ? first[count / 2]
        : std::midpoint( first[ count / 2 ], first[ count / 2 + 1 ] );
}
```


It is possible to enable only precondition or only postcondition checking with one of the following macros:

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG_CONTRACT\_EXPECTS\_ONLY</b>  
Define this macro to permit runtime checking and evaluation for precondition contracts only.

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_ENSURES\_ONLY</b>  
Define this macro to permit runtime checking and evaluation for postcondition contracts only.


The following macros control the handling of runtime contract violations:

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_VIOLATION\_TERMINATES</b>  
Define this macro to call `std::terminate()` on a GSL contract violation in `Expects`, `ExpectsAudit`, `Ensures`, `EnsuresAudit`, and `narrow`. This is the default case.

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_VIOLATION\_THROWS</b>  
Define this macro to throw a std::runtime_exception-derived exception `gsl::fail_fast` instead of calling `std::terminate()` on a GSL contract violation in `Expects`, `ExpectsAudit`, `Ensures`, `EnsuresAudit`, and throw a std::exception-derived exception `narrowing_error` on discarding information in `narrow`.

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_VIOLATION\_CALLS\_HANDLER</b>  
Define this macro to call a user-defined handler function `gsl::fail_fast_assert_handler()` instead of calling `std::terminate()` on a GSL contract violation in `Expects`, `ExpectsAudit`, `Ensures`, and `EnsuresAudit`, and call `std::terminate()` on discarding information in `narrow`. The user is expected to supply a definition matching the following signature:

```Cpp
namespace gsl {
	gsl_api void fail_fast_assert_handler(
		char const * const expression, char const * const message,
		char const * const file, int line );
}
```

### Microsoft GSL compatibility macros

\-D<b>GSL_UNENFORCED_ON_CONTRACT_VIOLATION</b>  
Equivalent to -Dgsl_CONFIG_CONTRACT_LEVEL_OFF.

\-D<b>GSL\_THROW\_ON\_CONTRACT\_VIOLATION</b>  
Equivalent to -Dgsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_VIOLATION\_THROWS.

\-D<b>GSL\_TERMINATE\_ON\_CONTRACT\_VIOLATION</b>  
Equivalent to -Dgsl\_CONFIG\_CONTRACT\_VIOLATION\_TERMINATES.

### Other configuration macros

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_DEPRECATE\_TO\_LEVEL</b>=0  
Define this to and including the level you want deprecation; see table [Deprecation](#deprecation) below. Default is 0 for no deprecation.

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_SPAN\_INDEX\_TYPE</b>=size_t  
Define this macro to the type to use for indices in `span` and `basic_string_span`. Microsoft's GSL uses `std::ptrdiff_t`. Default for *gsl lite* is `size_t`.

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_NOT\_NULL\_EXPLICIT\_CTOR</b>=0  
Define this macro to 1 to make `not_null`'s constructor explicit. Default is 0. Note that in Microsoft's GSL the constructor is explicit. For implicit construction you can also use the *gsl lite*-specific `not_null`-derived class `not_null_ic`.

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_NOT\_NULL\_GET_BY\_CONST\_REF</b>=0  
Define this macro to 1 to have `not_null<>::get()` and relatives return by `T const &` instead of `T`. This may improve performance with types that have an expensive copy-constructor. Default is 0 for `T`. 

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_ALLOWS\_NONSTRICT\_SPAN\_COMPARISON</b>=1  
Define this macro to 0 to omit the ability to compare spans of different types, e.g. of different const-volatile-ness. To be able to compare a string_span with a cstring_span, non-strict span comparison must be available. Default is 1.

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_ALLOWS\_UNCONSTRAINED\_SPAN\_CONTAINER\_CTOR</b>=0  
Define this macro to 1 to add the unconstrained span constructor for containers for pre-C++11 compilers that cannot constrain the constructor. This constructor may prove too greedy and interfere with other constructors. Default is 0.

Note: an alternative is to use the constructor tagged `with_container`: span&lt;_value_type_> *s*(with_container, *cont*). 

\-D<b>gsl\_CONFIG\_CONFIRMS\_COMPILATION\_ERRORS</b>=0  
Define this macro to 1 to experience the by-design compile-time errors of the GSL components in the test suite. Default is 0.

Building the tests
------------------
To build the tests you need:

- [CMake](http://cmake.org), version 3.0 or later to be installed and in your PATH.
- A [suitable compiler](#reported-to-work-with). 

The [*lest* test framework](https://github.com/martinmoene/lest)  is included in the [test folder](test).
 
The following steps assume that the [GSL Lite source code](https://github.com/martinmoene/gsl-lite) has been cloned into a directory named `c:\gsl-lite`.

1. Create a directory for the build outputs for a particular architecture.  
Here we use c:\gsl-lite\build-win-x86-vc10.

        cd c:\gsl-lite
        md build-win-x86-vc10
        cd build-win-x86-vc10

2. Configure CMake to use the compiler of your choice (run `cmake --help` for a list).

        cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 2010" ..

3. Build the test suite in the Debug configuration (alternatively use Release).    

        cmake --build . --config Debug

4. Run the test suite.    

        ctest -V -C Debug

All tests should pass, indicating your platform is supported and you are ready to use *gsl-lite*. See the table with [supported types and functions](#features).

### A.1 Extract Boost smart pointers

To obtain a subset of Boost only containing the smart pointers, use the [bcp command](http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_59_0/tools/bcp/doc/html/index.html) like:

    C:\Libraries\boost\boost_1_51>bin\bcp scoped_ptr.hpp shared_ptr.hpp weak_ptr.hpp make_shared.hpp C:\Libraries\boost-shared_ptr

The smart pointers of Boost 1.51 can be used with VC6.

<a id="a2"></a>
### A.2 Compile-time information

The version of *gsl lite* is available via tag `[.version]`. The following tags are available for information on the compiler and on the C++ standard library used: `[.compiler]`, `[.stdc++]`, `[.stdlanguage]` and `[.stdlibrary]`.
